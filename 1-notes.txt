What is an ADT?

    An abstraction of concrete data structures (ds). It's the interface, and contract that ds must adhere to.

    The interface hides the details and complexity of the ds implementation.


Examples: 

    ADT (Interface)                         DS (Implementation)
    List                                    Dynamic Array, Linked List
    Queue / Stack                           Dynamic Array, Linked List
    Map                                     Hash Map, Tree Map


Arrays:

    1. Static arrays: hold a fixed length of elements.

        Stored in RAM memory, keeps track of the first block memory address and we know it's consecutively
        stored from there.

    2. Dynamic arrays: hold a dynamic length of elements.

    Useful for making lists of items, or storing related data.

    Insertion (constant time complexity):
        
        push(value)         -       insertion to end of array
        
        arr[i] = value      -       direct insertion in specified index
        
        unshift(value)      -       insertion to front of array

    Time Complexity:

        Operation               Cost
        Read                    O(1)
        Write                   O(1)
        Update                  O(1)
        Delete                  O(n) shifting elements to the right or left, then changing the size of the array
        Search                  O(n) looping through n elements to find an element


Linked Lists:

    A linear data structure where the elements are not stored in contiguous memory locations, instead the elements
    are linked using pointers.

    It contains a head and optionally a tail. The pointer points to the next node in the Singly Linked List (SLL).

    Usage:

        Spotify Music Playlist

        Stacks

        Queues

    Doubly Linked Lists (DLL) have pointers to its next and previous node.

    Time Complexity:

        Operation           SLL         DLL
        Insertion head      O(1)        O(1)
        Insertion middle    O(n)        O(n)
        Insertion tail      O(1)        O(1)
